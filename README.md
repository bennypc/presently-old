Presently is a dynamic and innovative web application designed to help users refine and elevate their public speaking skills. Our tool provides a user-friendly platform for practicing speeches, presentations, and more, offering immediate and actionable feedback on key performance areas.

Through artificial intelligence and machine learning, Presently analyzes user-uploaded videos and provides comprehensive reports on sentimental emotion detection, speech-to-text analysis, and eye-contact assessment. This combination of features enables users to have a clear understanding of their current speaking style and areas where they can improve.

The speech-to-text analysis feature transcribes the user's speech, allowing for further analysis on aspects such as word usage, speech complexity, clarity, and pace. This data-driven approach allows users to scientifically understand their speech patterns and craft more effective presentations.

The eye-contact training feature utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to evaluate the user's eye contact throughout their presentation. This feedback can help users improve their connection with their audience and convey confidence during their speeches.

With Presently, users have a personal and private platform for practicing and improving their public speaking skills at their own pace. Our goal is to empower individuals to communicate their ideas effectively and with confidence, helping them succeed in personal, academic, and professional environments.
